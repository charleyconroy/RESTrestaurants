# Spring RESTful services

Worked on a practice RESTful API service using 
[Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/)
as a tutorial.

The tutorial constructs a series of java files 
that create an employee repository.
I decided to instead create a repository of
restaurants.

There are two default values in the data that show the different fields.
The fields from the tutorial are the name and id fields.
I decided to add the cost, rating, and type fields to provide more information.
This gives me the room to add more functionality to the site later.
Specifically if I want to turn this into a restaurant recommendation site.

This was an attempt to learn RESTful practices for my internship.
The website I was working on used RESTful standards and this was my way of getting
familiar with them.
